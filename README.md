# NLP-Model-Deployment

Objective: to deploy a basic application on heroku platform.

Working: when a any text is put in the message box and predicted it will show either the text was a abusive text or a non abusive text. 

Pre-Processing.py: its the code used for cleaning and cleansing the textual data and to visualize the most repeated words using ngrams for getting more insights on the data.

model.py: its the code used for building the model and to to create the .pkl files.

NOTE: even though the model accuracy is around 90%, as it is trained on a limited data set sometimes the output maybe not accurate.
